**Self-hosted personal and business finance manager.** Track expenditures, monitor
monthly outgoings, and manage faith-based giving such as tithes and partnership,
with optional AI-powered receipt scanning. Separate **Personal** and **Business**
workspaces keep data fully isolated.

*Sika* is Twi for "money".

Your financial data stays on your own server. Nothing is sent anywhere unless you
explicitly enable the optional AI and storage integrations.

## Quick start

You need Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tickideasintl/sika.git
cd sika
cp .env.example .env

# Required: generate an auth secret and set a database password
sed -i "s|^BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=.*|BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)|" .env
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 24)" >> .env

docker compose up -d
```

Sika is now on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Migrations run
automatically on startup, so there is no separate setup step. Create an account
from the signup page; the first account is an ordinary user, and there is no
admin tier.

### Minimum configuration

Only three variables are required:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Session signing secret, `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Public origin, e.g. `https://sika.example.com` |

Everything else is optional. **Receipt scanning and file storage are off unless
you configure them**, so Sika runs fully offline with no third-party API keys.
Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to enable receipt scanning, and the `S3_*` variables to store
receipt images. The AI provider is configurable per user in Settings and works
with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, including a local Ollama instance.

See `.env.example` for the complete list.

### Before exposing it to the internet

The bundled `docker-compose.yml` is tuned for local use. For a public deployment:

- Remove the `ports:` mapping on the `db` service so Postgres is not reachable
- Set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` to strong generated values
- Put Sika behind a reverse proxy with TLS and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the
  HTTPS origin
- Set up database backups; Sika does not back itself up

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full checklist, and
[DOKPLOY.md](DOKPLOY.md) if you deploy with Dokploy.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: React 19
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Better Auth (Postgres adapter)
- **AI/OCR**: OpenAI Vision API
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible (AWS S3, MinIO, R2, etc.)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui + Radix UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Deployment**: Dokploy (self-hosted) or any Docker host

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24.x (24.13.0 or newer; Node 25+ is not supported) and npm
- PostgreSQL 16+ (local, Neon, Supabase, or Dokploy-managed)
- An OpenAI-compatible API key — optional, only for receipt scanning
- S3-compatible storage for receipt images — optional

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tickideasintl/sika.git
cd sika
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Key variables:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/sika
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<openssl rand -base64 32>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

See `.env.example` for the full list including S3 storage vars.

4. Run database migrations (**required**):
```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

> Production note: Docker runtime auto-runs migrations on startup, then verifies
> schema before serving traffic. See Dokploy runbook:
> `docs/PROD_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md`.

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

> For detailed setup instructions (including Dokploy deployment), see [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).
> For production release command order, use [docs/PROD_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md](docs/PROD_GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md).
> For future DB changes, use [docs/NEXT_DB_MIGRATION_TEMPLATE.md](docs/NEXT_DB_MIGRATION_TEMPLATE.md).

## Database

The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM. Main tables:

- **users / sessions / accounts** — managed by Better Auth
- **workspaces** — personal and business finance workspaces per user
- **transactions** — user financial transactions (scoped by workspace, indexed by user, date, type, category)
- **categories** — user-defined and default categories (per workspace)
- **budgets** — budget allocations with period-based tracking (per workspace)
- **recurring_outgoings** — monthly recurring bills and subscriptions (per workspace)
- **debts_credits** — credit cards, loans, and other debts (per workspace)
- **loans_given** — money lent to others (per workspace)
- **investments** — stocks, crypto, property, and other assets (per workspace)

### Database Commands

```bash
npm run db:generate   # Generate SQL migrations from schema changes
npm run db:migrate    # Apply pending migrations
npm run db:studio     # Open Drizzle Studio GUI
```

## Dependency Maintenance Note

Dependencies were upgraded and the app was verified with:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Both commands pass on the current dependency set.

### esbuild override (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)

`npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities. Keeping it that way depends on the `overrides`
block in `package.json`:

```json
"overrides": {
  "@esbuild-kit/core-utils": {
    "esbuild": "^0.25.12"
  }
}
```

`drizzle-kit` still depends on the deprecated `@esbuild-kit/esm-loader` chain, which
otherwise pulls in `esbuild@0.18.20` and four moderate advisories. The override forces
that nested copy onto a patched release, where it dedupes onto the `esbuild` version
`drizzle-kit` already ships.

Do not remove this block until `drizzle-kit` drops `@esbuild-kit/esm-loader`; doing so
silently reintroduces the advisories. The `audit` job in CI guards against this.

Do not run `npm audit fix --force` here either, because it tries to downgrade
`drizzle-kit` to 0.18.1.

An earlier attempt at this override was recorded as producing an invalid dependency
tree. The cause was a stale `node_modules`/lockfile: npm reuses the existing tree and
will not apply a new override on top of it. Removing the affected subtree and letting
the lockfile regenerate resolves it cleanly, which is how the current tree was produced.

After changing `drizzle-kit`, re-run `npm audit`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.
